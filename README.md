# ES6-Project-1
Create a simple "to-do list" application, using client-side HTML, CSS, and Javascript only. This application should store its data using localStorage only, and should not connect to any external APIs, backends, databases etc. This should function as a "Single Page Application", so the page should never actually refresh or reload, and no links should direct to any other page. Instead, when links are clicked (or forms are submitted), the contents of the page should disappear and the new content should be loaded in its place, all without actually redirecting the user.

### Issues
To look over in the future:
- [ ] Make page more responsive
- [ ] Save strike through values
- [ ] Make code dry
